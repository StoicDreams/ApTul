> Simple, privacy-focused web tools built to solve real-world development problems

## Introduction

<webui-page-segment elevation="10">
Welcome to Ap Tul, a growing collection of online utilities designed to streamline the day-to-day tasks of software development.

This site is built on a simple philosophy: **Necessity breeds creation**.

As a software developer, I often encounter niche tasks - like specific file conversions or data formatting - that require simple, immediate solutions. Instead of scouring the web for ad-heavy third-party tools, I build the solutions I need myself and add them here. The result is a library of lightweight, purpose-built tools that prioritize function, speed, and privacy.

### Why Use Ap Tul?

<webui-page-segment elevation="10">
- **Built for Real Workflows**: Every tool on this site exists because it was needed for a real project.
- **Privacy First**: Many online tools require uploading files to a server. My tools, like the Image Converter, utilize technologies like Rust and WebAssembly to process data directly in your browser.
- **No Clutter**: No paywalls, no aggressive ads, just the utility you need.

#### Newest Addition: Image Converter & Resizer

<webui-page-segment elevation="10">
I recently needed a fast way to batch-convert PNGs to WebP and resize them for a web project. The result is the [Ap Tul Image Converter](/image-converter).

- **Features**: Resize images with preserved aspect ratios, convert formats (PNG, WebP, JPG, ICO), and automatically strip sensitive metadata (GPS, EXIF) for enhanced privacy.
- **Tech**: Powered by Rust and WebAssembly for native-level performance within the browser.
